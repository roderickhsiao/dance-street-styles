# Fast Origin Transfer (FOT) Optimization Guide

## Changes Made to Reduce Fast Origin Transfer Costs

### 1. Middleware Optimization
- **Refined matcher pattern** to exclude static assets and unnecessary routes
- **Reduced double-processing** by avoiding middleware for files with extensions
- **Excluded internal Next.js routes** (`_next`, `_vercel`, etc.) from i18n processing

### 2. Image Optimization Configuration
- **Enhanced Next.js Image config** with optimal device sizes and image sizes
- **Enabled modern formats** (AVIF, WebP) for better compression
- **Set aggressive caching** (1 year TTL for optimized images)
- **Added security headers** for SVG handling

### 3. Manual Image Compression
- **Optimized warehouse image**: 2.7MB → 606KB (77% reduction)
- **Created optimization script** for batch processing remaining images
- **Modern format support** with WebP fallbacks

### 4. Caching Headers
- **Added comprehensive headers** for static assets and Next.js bundles
- **Immutable caching** for static resources with long TTLs
- **Proper cache control** to reduce repeat transfers

### 5. Bundle Analysis Setup
- **Added build:analyze script** for identifying large bundles
- **Monitoring capabilities** for ongoing optimization

## Expected Cost Reduction

### Image Transfer Reduction
- **Large images optimized**: 70-80% size reduction on major assets
- **Modern formats**: Additional 20-30% savings with WebP/AVIF
- **Caching improvements**: 90%+ reduction on repeat visits

### Middleware Efficiency
- **Reduced processing**: 40-50% fewer middleware executions
- **Static asset bypass**: Eliminated unnecessary i18n processing

### Response Caching
- **Edge cache hits**: Dramatic reduction in origin transfer for static content
- **Long TTLs**: Minimize repeat generation of optimized content

## Fast Origin Transfer Optimization Strategy

### High-Impact Optimizations ✅
1. **Image compression and modern formats**
2. **Middleware path exclusions**
3. **Static asset caching headers**
4. **ISR with proper revalidation intervals**

### Medium-Impact Optimizations ✅
1. **Bundle size awareness**
2. **API response optimization**
3. **OG image caching**

### Monitoring and Analysis

#### Vercel Dashboard Metrics to Watch
- **Fast Origin Transfer usage** by direction (incoming/outgoing)
- **Top Paths analysis** to identify high-transfer routes
- **Regional breakdown** for cost optimization

#### Key Metrics
- **Outgoing transfer reduction**: Should see 60-80% reduction
- **Image optimization hits**: Monitor `/_next/image` path usage
- **Cache hit rates**: Should improve significantly

#### Investigation Tools
```bash
# Use in your monitoring queries
request_path = '/_next/image' OR request_path = '/_vercel/image'
```

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

### 1. Run Image Optimization Script
```bash
./optimize-images.sh
```

### 2. Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

### 3. Component-Level Optimizations
- Use `priority` prop for above-the-fold images
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use `placeholder="blur"` for better perceived performance

### 4. Advanced Optimizations
- Consider implementing service worker for additional caching
- Evaluate using CDN for static assets
- Monitor and adjust revalidation intervals based on usage

## Code Examples

### Optimized Image Usage
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

// Above the fold - use priority
<Image
  src="/images/hero-image.webp"
  alt="Description"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
/>

// Below the fold - lazy load
<Image
  src="/images/content-image.webp"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### Response Headers Check
Monitor these headers in browser dev tools:
- `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `content-encoding: gzip` or `br`
- Response sizes in Network tab

## Key Performance Indicators

### Before Optimization
- Large PNG files: 2.7MB warehouse image
- Unoptimized middleware processing all routes
- No aggressive caching headers
- Missing modern image format support

### After Optimization
- **77% image size reduction** on largest assets
- **Selective middleware processing** only for necessary routes
- **1-year caching** for static assets
- **Modern format support** with automatic optimization

### Expected ROI
- **60-80% reduction** in Fast Origin Transfer costs
- **Improved performance** from better caching and smaller assets
- **Better user experience** with faster image loading
